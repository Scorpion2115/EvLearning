# Task
Create a new NetworkPolicy named allow-port-from-namespace in the existing namespace fubar.
Ensure that the new NetworkPolicy allows Pods in namespace internal to connect to port 9000 of Pods in namespace fubar.
Further ensure that the new NetworkPolicy:
* does not allow access to Pods, which don't listen on port 9000
* does not allow access from Pods, which are not in namespace internal

## Solution
1. label the namespace for namespace selector in the network policy
```bash
kubectl label ns internal app=internal
```

```yml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-port-from-namespace
  namespace: fubar
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
  ingress:
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: internal
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 9000
  egress:
    - to:
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 9000
```
