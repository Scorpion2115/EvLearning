# Task 
An existing Pod needs to be integrated into the Kubernetes built-in logging architecture (e.g. kubectl logs). Adding a streaming sidecar container is a good and common way to accomplish this requirement.
* Add a sidecar container named `sidecar`, using the `busybox` image, to the existing Pod `big-corp-app`. The new sidecar container has to run the following command:
![img](./img/t13-sidecar.jpg)
* Use a Volume, mounted at `/var/log`, to make the log file `big-corp-app.log `available to the sidecar container.

## Solution
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: two-containers
spec:

  restartPolicy: Never

  volumes:
  - name: shared-data
    emptyDir: {}

  containers:

  - name: big-corp-app
    image: busybox
    volumeMounts:
    - name: shared-data
      mountPath: /usr/share
    command: ["/bin/sh"]
    args: ["-c", "echo log1 > /usr/share/big-corp-app.log"]

  - name: sidecar
    image: busybox
    volumeMounts:
    - name: shared-data
      mountPath: /var/log
    command: ["/bin/sh"]
    args: ["-c", "tail -n+1 > /var/log/big-corp-app.log"]
```
