# Using Kubernetes Volumes
1. Create a Pod that uses a hostPath volume to store data on the host.
```bash
kubectl apply -f volume-pod.yml
```

2. Check which worker node the pod is running on.
```bash
kubectl get pod volume-pod -o wide -n demo
```
3. Log in to that host and verify the contents of the output file.
```bash
cat /var/data/success.txt 

## Success!
```

4. Create a multi-container Pod with an emptyDir volume shared between containers
```bash
kubectl apply -f shared-volume-pod.yml
```

5. Check the container log for busybox2. You should see the data that was generated by busybox1.
```bash
kubectl logs shared-volume-pod -n demo -c busybox2
```
