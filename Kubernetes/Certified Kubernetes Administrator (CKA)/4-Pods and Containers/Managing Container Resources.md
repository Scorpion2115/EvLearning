# Managing Container Resources
* Resource Request
* Resource Limits

## Resource Requests
Allows you to define an amount of resources (CPU or Memory) you expect a container to use.
* CPU is measured by CPU units, which are <span style="color:blue">1/1000</span> of one CPU
* Memory is measured by <span style="color:blue">bytes</span>


The Kubernetes scheduler will use resources requests to avoid scheduling pods on nodes that do not have enough available resources

<span style="color:red">Containers are allowed to use more (or less) than the requested resources. Resource requests only affect `scheduling`</span>.

## Resource Limits
Provide a way for you to limit the amount of resources your container can use

The container runtime is responsible for enforcing these limits

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: resource-pod
spec:
containers:
- name: busybox
    image: busybox
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'while true; do sleep 3600; done']
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: "250m"
        memory: "128Mi"
      limits:
        cpu: "500m"
        memory: "256Mi"
```
