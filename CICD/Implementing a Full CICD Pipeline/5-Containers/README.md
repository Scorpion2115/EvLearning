# Container
## Why Container
How to resolve these questions:
- Scaling
- Server outage
- Configuration drift (the potential difference between dev and prod environment)

typical VM solution is having these drawbacks
- Slow
- Use lots of resources
- Not portable
- We need orchestrate deployment cross a big bunch of VMs

With containers, we can:
- Stand up or tear down instance quickly
- Distribute the whole app include the "server" in ready-to-use state
- Run the containers on both dev and prod environment
- Easily manage automation to provision and orchestrate the container instances
